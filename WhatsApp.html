		<p>WhatsApp Messenger, or simply WhatsApp, is an internationally available freeware, cross-platform centralized instant messaging (IM) and voice-over-IP (VoIP) service owned by American company Meta Platforms.[12] It allows users to send text messages and voice messages,[13] make voice and video calls, and share images, documents, user locations, and other content.[14][15] WhatsApp's client application runs on mobile devices but is also accessible from desktop computers.[16] The service requires a cellular mobile telephone number to sign up.[17] In January 2018, WhatsApp released a standalone business app targeted at small business owners, called WhatsApp Business, to allow companies to communicate with customers who use the standard WhatsApp client.[18][19]</p>
