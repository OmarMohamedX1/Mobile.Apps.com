		<p>Instagram is one of the most popular apps and largest social media platforms. It has approximately 1.4 billion monthly users. It was launched in 2010 and was acquired by Facebook two years later.
            <br>
            It is a great marketing tool and many big brands upload posts frequently here through Instagram Lives, IGTV, and stories to engage the audience. With the launch of Reels two years ago, it is now in direct competition with TikTok.</p>
